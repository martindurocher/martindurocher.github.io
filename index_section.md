### Interest  

Innovation in computer science allows statisticians to develop more realistic models that are better adapted for real world phenomena. 
My research aims at integrating and validating recent statistical techniques to solve practical problems in hydrology. 
I am interested in practical applications of nonparametric regression, multivariate data analysis, nonlinear time series, spatial statistics and extreme value theory; which becomes useful to improve spatial prediction of hydrological variable an to investigate the measurable impacts of climate changes.  

I am currently involved in Theme 1-6 of the National FloodNet project for of the development of new flood estimation manual and software for flood estimation in Canada.
