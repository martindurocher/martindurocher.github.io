# Current position 

I am a postdoctoral fellow in water science at the Universtiy under the supervision of Prof. Donald Burns. 
My main project is theme 1-6 of the [FloodNet Canadian Strategic Network](http://www.nsercfloodnet.ca), which consist to produce a manual and statistical tools for flood frequency analysis in Canada. 
   
# Interest  

Innovation in computer science allows statisticians to develop more realistic and flexible models for real world phenomena. 
My research aims at integrating and validating new statistical methods to solve practical problems in hydrology. 
I am current involved in the improvement of the spatial modeling of hydrological variables and their predictions at ungauged bassins.
